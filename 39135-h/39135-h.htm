<h3>
<span>PERKIN WARBECK.</span>
</h3>


<p>In the <i>Minutes of Evidence</i> taken by the Select Committee on the
British Museum, in May, 1836, p. 308., mention is made of "a paper
giving an account of the landing of Perkin Warbeck, signed by Sir Henry
Wentworth, and dated 16th [17th] Sept. 1497," as of historical value.
This "paper" was at that time in the possession of the late Mr. Upcott;
and when I drew up for the society of Antiquaries the article on "Perkin
Warbeck's History," printed in the <i>Archæologia</i>, vol. xxvii. pp.
153-210., I had no opportunity of seeing it, and therefore merely made a
brief reference to it in a foot-note. The document subsequently passed,
together with a large and valuable portion of Upcott's collection, into
the hands of M. Donnadieu, and at the recent sale of that gentleman's
collection of autographs was purchased for the British Museum. It is a
letter from Sir Harry Wentworth of Nettlested, co. Suffolk (ancestor of
the Barons Wentworth), addressed to Sir William Calverley, of Calverley
in Yorkshire, from whom descended the extinct baronets of that name. The
letter is not of great historical importance, yet, as furnishing some
notices of the measures taken by the king, on learning that Perkin had
landed in Cornwall, on the 7th of September (only ten days previous), it
will not be read without interest. The letter is written on a strip of
paper measuring eleven inches by four inches, and is signed only by Sir
Harry Wentworth.</p>

<h3>
<span>A HEBREW SERMON IN ENGLISH STONE<br />
(<i>Alias, A Puzzle of long standing solved</i>).</span>
</h3>

<p>Some of the readers of the "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" may have chanced, as was
the case with the writer, to have enjoyed a ramble through the park and
village of Wentworth, in Yorkshire, one of Earl Fitzwilliam's estates.
Should such be the case, the ramblers could not have failed to halt half
an hour, probably an hour, before a neat house, now inhabited by one of
his lordship's agents, and wonder and ponder over the intent and purport
of a curious inscription, on a stone sun-dial, which is placed over the
door of the house. Such I have learned to be the case with every new
passer-by. Having spent some time in musing over the hitherto
inexplicable puzzle, I think that I am enabled at last to offer a sort
of solution of the same. I shall therefore at first give a simple
description of the contents of the stone, and then my version of it.</p>

<p>In the centre of the slab, a dial plate is inserted; on its left are
carved three lines, running thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
            <p class="i5">  "Bezaleel Benevent</p>
      <p class="i3">Sculptor Israelite. Isaiah xliv. 5.</p>
          <p class="i5">Maker. I am 58 years old.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">On its right, eight lines are carved, and run thus:</p>

<div class="poem">

           <p class="i5"> "1740 years of</p>
 <p class="i7"> <span title="[Hebrew: mem, mem, shin, yod, resh]">&#1502;&#1502;&#1513;&#1497;&#1512;</span></p>
         <p class="i3"> A stone of stumbling.</p>
      <p class="i3"> See Isaiah viii. 14, 15.</p>
      <p class="i3">Ps. cxix. 165. Ezek. iii. 20</p>
        <p class="i5">A stumbling-block.</p>
           <p class="i5">Beware of Him.</p>
             <p class="i7">Mal. i. 11."</p>

</div>

<p>There is scarcely any difficulty as regards the inscription on the left;
the purport being a brief and clumsy account of the sculptor himself.
The reason of the reference at the end of the second line may be a sort
of justification for suffixing "Israelite" to his name; the following
being the passage referred to: "One shall say, I am the Lord's; and
another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall
subscribe with his hand unto the Lord, and <i>surname himself by the name
of Israel</i>." The principal perplexity is presented by the inscription on
the right, and especially in the second line; containing, as it does, a
group of five Hebrew letters, so arranged as to defy the ingenuity of
the most erudite lexicographer; there being no word of such construction
in the whole range of Hebrew literature.</p>

<p>I must premise, before I proceed any further, by stating that I
apprehend the sculptor to have been a zealous, though very eccentric,
Jewish convert to Christianity; to whom it seemed good to put up that
enigmatical sun-dial, with a view to attract the attention, and conduce
the inquiry of his Hebrew brethren; which would afford him an
opportunity of propounding his Christian views from his own design.</p>

<p>I take the Hebrew letters
<span title="[Hebrew: mem, mem, shin, yod, resh]"> &#1502; &#1502;  &#1513;  &#1497; &#1512; </span>
 to be the initials of the
following words:<a id="words4"></a><a title="Go to footnote 4." href="#fn4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> </p>

<p class="center">
<img src="images/image01.jpg" width="200" height="25" alt="Hebrew words" />         </p>




<p class="footnote"><a id="fn4"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#words4" class="label">[4]</a> According to the first canon of cabbalistical
interpretation, called <i>Notricon</i>. See <i>The Fundamental Principles of
Modern Judaism Investigated</i>, pp. 13, 14.</p>

<p>"The King Messiah, the Shiloh, the Lord my Shepherd." Hence those
characters follow the <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> date of
 the first line, and are followed by
the appropriate words in the third line, viz. "A stone of stumbling."
The fourth line then comes as a sort of explanation of the preceding
one: "And He shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling, and
for a rock of offence, to both the houses of Israel; for a gin and for a
snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And many among them shall
stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken." "See
Isaiah viii. 14, 15." The fifth line, "Ps. cxix. 165. Ezek. iii. 20."
consists of scriptural references as to the cause and effect of loving
the law, and <i>vice versâ</i>; the first reference being, "Great peace have
they which love thy law, and no stumbling-block for them" [according to
the original]. The second reference being, "Again, when a righteous man
doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a
stumbling-block before him, he shall die; because thou hast not given
him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he
hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine
hand." The words in the sixth line, "A stumbling-block," evidently refer
to 1 Cor. i. 23.: "But we preach Christ crucified; unto the Jews a
stumbling-block." The "sculptor Israelite" may have feared that a
reference to the New Testament would betray his motive, and therefore
judged it prudent and expedient to omit it. The supposition that
Bezaleel had 1 Cor. i. 23. in view is supported by the seventh line,
"Beware of Him." The last line appears to be an appropriate conclusion;
as the passage referred to describes the extent of the Lord's kingdom,
as well as his reception by "all nations, tongues, and kindreds." "For
from the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my
name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall
be offered unto my name, and a peace offering; for my name shall be
great among the heathen, saith the Lord of hosts." Mal. i. 11.</p>

<h3>
<span>VALUE OF SHAKSPEARE'S LEAGUE.&mdash;MEANING OF SHIP.&mdash;LOG-SHIP.</span>
</h3>

<p>So universal was Shakspeare's knowledge even of the arcana of other
men's pursuits, that his commentators, in their anxiety to reduce his
attainments to an ordinary standard, have attributed to him a sort of
ubiquitous apprenticeship to all manner of trades and callings,&mdash;now a
butcher,&mdash;now an attorney's clerk,&mdash;now a schoolmaster,&mdash;and anon a
holder of horses at the theatre door, where doubtless he acquired that
farrier-knowledge so profusely lavished upon Petruchio's charger in <i>The
Taming of the Shrew</i>. Dr. Farmer, amongst other atrocities which have
earned for him an unenviable immortality in connexion with Shakspeare's
name, had the incredible folly to recognise, in the splendid image&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>  "There's a divinity that shapes our ends,</p>
   <p>   Rough-hew them how we will,"</p>

</div>
<p>an allusion to <i>skewer making</i>! in which the rough-hewing was
Shakspeare's, while his more skilful sire <i>shaped the ends</i>! Even Dr.
Johnson cried "shop" at that passage of <i>The Winter's Tale</i> where
Perdita, fearing lest Florizel's father might discover him "obscured
with a swain's wearing," exclaims&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "How would he look to see his work so noble</p>
    <p>  Vilely bound up."</p>
</div>

<p>Whereupon the great critic utters this sapient apothegm, "It is
impossible for any man to rid his mind of his profession"&mdash;meaning of
course Shakspeare's profession of <i>book making</i>!</p>

<p>It is therefore surprising that none of them should have discovered a
trace of Shakspeare in the occupation of <i>ship-boy</i>; since in no calling
has he shown a more accurate knowledge of technicalities; and his
seamanship has satisfied the strictest professional criticism. It is to
this circumstance my attention is more especially directed at present by
a singular blunder which I have observed in one of the illustrations to
Knight's <i>Illustrated Shakspeare</i>.</p>

<p>The artist, W. Dicks, professes to illustrate Ægeon's description of his
shipwreck, taking for his text these lines in the first scene of the
<i>Comedy of Errors</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">
   <p>"We were encounter'd by a mighty rock,</p>
     <p> Which being violently borne upon</p>
    <p>  Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst."</p>
</div>

<p>But if he had studied the context he would have perceived that the
"helpful ship" was not a goodly argosy, as he has depicted it, but "a
small spare mast, such as seafaring men provide for storms."</p>

<p>Now, it must not be said that the inadvertence is Shakspeare's, because
the term <i>helpful</i>, indicative of sudden resource, and these lines
immediately following&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "So, that in this unjust divorce of us</p>
     <p> Fortune had left to both of us alike</p>
     <p> What to delight in&mdash;what to sorrow for"&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p>prove that Shakspeare never for a moment lost sight of the circumstances
he was describing.</p>

<p>I was endeavouring to discover what particular nautical technicality
might justify this application of <i>ship</i> in the sense of <i>raft</i> or
<i>float</i>, when I recollected that sailors call the little float by which
the log-line is held stationary in the water, by the term <i>log-ship</i>;
and, by a rather singular coincidence, the origin of this very word
<i>log-ship</i> is made the subject of comment in a recent number of
"N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" (p. 254.), by a West Indian correspondent, A. L., who
thinks the term log-<i>chip</i>.</p>

<p>His story, however, if it be not altogether the offspring of his own
ingenuity, appears quite unsupported by evidence; nor, even if
authenticated, would it be conclusive of the inference he draws from it.
For, surely, the same origin might be attributed to <i>log</i> itself, with
equal, or even with greater probability. The very nature of log is, not
only to float, but to remain sluggish or stationary in the water: and as
it might not be convenient to provide a fresh log (or chip) for every
occasion, there would be a clear advantage in tying a string to it, for
the purpose of hauling it inboard again, to serve another turn.
Moreover, I must remind A. L. that sailors do not say, "Heave the
<i>chip</i>," but "Heave the <i>log</i>."</p>

<p>This same passage in the <i>Comedy of Errors</i> suggests another
consideration; which is, that Shakspeare appears to have used <i>league</i>
and <i>mile</i> synonymously. When Ægeon's "helpful ship" was "splitted in
the midst," it was "ere the ships" (approaching to his rescue) "could
meet by thrice five leagues;" so that each ship must have been at least
five leagues distant when discovered. Now Shakspeare was too good a
sailor to suppose that a ship could be visible to a man on the
surface<a id="Page_380"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[380]</span> of the water a distance of <i>fifteen</i> miles; but at
<i>one-third</i> of that distance it might be so. Therefore it would be
necessary to take <i>league</i> as synonymous with <i>mile</i> in this instance,
even if it were not corroborated by the necessity for a similar
understanding in other places.</p>

<p>But wherever Shakspeare uses the word <i>league</i>, its equivalence with
<i>mile</i> is not only consistent with the sense, but, in some cases,
absolutely necessary to it.</p>

<p>Thus, in the opening scene of the <i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, Lysander
appoints to meet Hermia "in the wood, a <i>league</i> without the town," but,
in the next scene, Quince appoints the same place for the rehearsal,
calling it "the palace wood, a <i>mile</i> without the town."</p>

<p>Again, in the <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, when Silvia escapes with
Eglamour, the latter reassures her by reminding her that they will be
safe if they can "gain the forest, not three leagues off," which would
be but poor comfort if by three leagues the lady was to understand nine
miles.</p>

<p>By the way, this forest is described in all the "stage directions," upon
what authority I cannot guess, as "a forest near Mantua;" whereas all
the circumstances concur to place it in the immediate vicinity of Milan.
There is nothing to warrant the supposition that any of the characters
had journeyed far from Milan when they were seized upon by the outlaws;
and it is to the Duke of Milan that the outlaws apply for pardon for
misdeeds done in his territories.</p>

<h3>
<span>DONIZETTI.</span>
</h3>


<p>The following very curious account of the ancestry of this very talented
individual is copied from the <i>Berwick Advertiser</i>&mdash;a paper confined to
the provinces, and not likely to reach the metropolis. It appeared
somewhere about four years ago; but in cutting the scrap from the paper
I incautiously omitted inserting the date.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<span class="smaller">NEW FACTS CONCERNING DONIZETTI THE COMPOSER.</span>&mdash;We have learned
   from authority not to be questioned, that the late Donizetti,
   whose great talents as a composer are now beginning to be
   appreciated, was of Scotch origin. His grandfather was a native
   of Perthshire, of the name of Izett (or rather, I should think,
   Izatt). He was a farmer under the Earl of Breadalbane, and his
   son Donald was born at the farm. When very young the sprightly
   Donald left his paternal home, having been enticed by the
   fascinating address of a recruiting serjeant to enlist in the
   united services of Mars and his Majesty, to the great grief of
   his mother, who did not survive his departure many months. Young
   Donald soon got discontented with his military duties; and having
   been taken prisoner by General La Hoche during his invasion of
   Ireland, was quite delighted with the easy mode which presented
   itself of liberation from the unpleasant thraldom which he had
   been suffering, and quickly embraced an offer made to him to
   enter the General's service. With him he remained as private
   secretary till his untimely death. Subsequently he married an
   Italian lady of some fortune, and his name of <i>Donald Izett</i> was
   easily metamorphosed into <i>Donizetti</i>. The composer was the
   offspring of this marriage; and it is remarkable that evidence of
   his Scottish origin may be traced in many of his beautiful
   melodies. Thus, for instance, in 'Don Pasquale,' the exquisite
   air of 'O Summer Night' reminds us of some Highland strains sung
   to the bagpipe; and the entire score of 'Lucia di Lammermoor' is
   replete with snatches and fragments of the minstrelsy of
   Scotland."</p>


<p>There is then added a few lines relative to Rossini, whose family is
also alleged to be Scotch.</p>

<p>How far this legend is true I know not; but perhaps some of your
correspondents might throw light on the subject. But assuredly there
<i>did</i> exist a Scotch family called <i>Izett</i>; and a lady of that name is
at present living in, or near, the romantic town of Stirling. What is
remarkable is this: that in the list of subscribers to the Edinburgh
Circus, afterwards better known as Corri's Rooms, and now the Adelphi
Theatre, occurs the name of <i>Izatt</i> or <i>Izett</i>, who followed the calling
of a hatter. This was in 1790. On making inquiry, it has been
ascertained that he came from Perthshire; that his father was a farmer
there; and what is still more striking, that, having realised an ample
fortune, he retired from business and purchased an estate in that
county. It was also said, that he corresponded with some relative on the
Continent. All this is very inconclusive, but still it is worth
noticing.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Ash Sap&mdash;The Ash</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iv., p. 273.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The reason for giving ash sap
to new-born children in the Highlands of Scotland is, first, because it
acts as a powerful astringent, and, secondly, because the ash, in common
with the rowan, is supposed to possess the property of resisting the
attacks of witches, fairies, and other imps of darkness. Without some
precaution of this kind, they would change the child, or possibly steal
it away altogether. The herd boys in the district of Buchan, in
Aberdeenshire, always prefer a herding stick of ash to any other wood,
as in throwing it at their cattle, it is <i>sure</i> not to strike on a vital
part, and so kill or injure the animal, which they say a stick of any
other wood <i>might</i> do.</p>

   <div class="poem">
   <p>"Rowan, ash, and red thread,</p>

<p>It is common practice with the housewives in the same district, to tie a
piece of red worsted thread round their cows' tails, previous to turning
them out to grass for the first time in the spring.<a id="Page_381"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[381]</span> It secures

<h4>
<span><i>Souling.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;On the 2nd of November, All Souls' Day, it is in Shropshire
the custom for the village children to go round to all their neighbours
souling, as they call it, collecting small contributions, and singing
the following verses, which I took down from two of the children
themselves:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

    <div class="stanza">
 <p>Soul! soul! for a soul-cake;</p>
      <p>Pray, good mistress, for a soul-cake.</p>
      <p>One for Peter, two for Paul,</p>
      <p>Three for Them who made us all.</p>
</div>

      <div class="stanza">
<p>Soul! soul! for an apple or two;</p>
      <p>If you've got no apples, pears will do.</p>
      <p>Up with your kettle, and down with your pan;</p>
      <p>Give me a good big one, and I'll be gone.</p>
                <p class="i7">Soul! soul! for a soul-cake;</p>
             <p class="i7">Pray, good mistress, a soul-cake, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

     <div class="stanza">
 <p>An apple or pear, a plum or a cherry,</p>
      <p>Is a very good thing to make us merry.</p>
                 <p class="i7">Soul! soul! &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The soul-cake referred to in the verses is a sort of bun, which until
lately it was an almost general custom for persons to make, and to give
to one another on the 2nd of November. Perhaps some of your readers can
state whether this custom prevails in other counties in England. It
seems to be a remnant of the practice of collecting alms, to be applied
to the benefit of the souls of the departed, for which especial masses
and services were formerly sung on All Souls' Day.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Pasquinade.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;To the "Pasquinades" adduced in Vol. iv., p. 292., I may
add one of a different character, though of older date, on a former
Cardinal. On the decease of Pope Clement IX. in 1669, Cardinal Bona was
named amongst those worthy of the tiara, when a French Jesuit (Père
Dangières), in reply to a line inscribed, as usual upon those occasions,
on the statue of Pasquin, "Papa Bona sarebbe un solecisma," made the
following epigram:</p>


<div class="poem">
     <p> "Grammaticæ leges plerumque Ecclesia spernit:</p>
      <p class="i3">Forte erit ut liceat dicere Papa Bona.</p>
     <p> Vana solæcismi ne te conturbat imago,</p>
      <p class="i3">Esset Papa bonus, si Bona Papa erit."</p>
</div>


<p>The successful candidate, however, was Cardinal Emilio Altieri, who
assumed the name of Clement X., in April, 1670: Bona (Giov.) died in
October, 1674.</p>

</h2>


<h3>
<span>ROMAN FUNERAL PILE.</span>
</h3>


<p>Did the Romans throw corn, pulse, or beans on the flames of the funeral
pile (<i>rogus</i>), or deposit them with the bones and ashes of the deceased
in their sepulchres? The Query is suggested by a quantity of, to all
appearance, calcined small field beans having recently been found by me,
in small heaps, among a deposit of ashes embedded in sand, in the
perpendicular cutting of a sand-pit at Comb Wood, near Kingston. The
deposit is black, reduced to a fine powder, and, with the exception of
the beans, homogeneous: it was perfectly distinct from the surrounding
sand, and was about two feet under the surface of the soil. For
centuries past Roman remains have been from time to time discovered at
Comb Wood, and it is known to have been a Roman station. The locality in
which I found the deposit is said to have been the sepulchre of the
station; and from an intelligent person, engaged in excavating the sand,
I learned that he occasionally came upon deposits similar to that in
question, containing baked, but unglazed, clay vessels; some, of an oval
form, about a yard in circumference and nearly a foot in depth, and
others of the size and somewhat of the form of a flower-pot. These
vessels fall to pieces after two or three days, through exposure to the
air. He had also found pieces of copper or brass about an inch square,
and of the thickness of a penny, as also coins.</p>

<p>Authorities (Virg. <i>Æn.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span> 225.;
 <i>Stat. Theb.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span> 126.;

175.) may be cited, showing that perfumes, cups of oil, ornaments,
clothes, dishes of food, and other things supposed to be agreeable to
the deceased, were thrown upon the flames; but I do not find corn or
beans specifically mentioned as having been used on these occasions.</p>

<p>I may add, that the field containing the sand-pit (which is the property
of His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge) is close to the road
leading by Putney Heath to Kingston, and on the brow of the declivity of
Comb Hill, overlooking that ancient Saxon seat of royalty which is
stated to have been built out of the remains of the adjoining Roman
station.</p>

<h3>
<span>DACRES OF THE NORTH.</span>
</h3>



<p>William Lord Dacre, of the North, had four sons: 1. Thomas; 2. Leonard;
3. Edward; 4. Francis. The eldest son Thomas married, and died in his
father's lifetime; leaving a son George, and three daughters, all under
age. This George, on his grandfather's death, became Lord Dacre; and was
in ward to the Duke of Norfolk during his minority, and his mother
became the Duke's second wife. George Lord Dacre was accidentally killed
before he attained his majority, leaving his three sisters his
coheiresses-at-law. Two of the coheiresses were married to the Duke's
two sons, the Earl of Arundel and Lord William Howard. Can any of your
readers state what became of the third sister?</p>

<p>On the death of George Lord Dacre, the title and estates were claimed by
Leonard, the second son of William Lord Dacre, by virtue of an alleged
entail on the heirs male of William. Leonard, taking part in the
rebellion of 1569, was attainted and fled abroad; and soon afterwards
died, and is buried at Brussels, I think. The next brother, Edward, was
also implicated, and fled. Is it known when and where he died; and did
he leave any issue?</p>

<p>Francis, the fourth son of William Lord Dacre, carried on a long contest
at law with the Earl of Arundel and the Lord William Howard for the
Dacre's estates; claiming, under the entail of his father William Lord
Dacre on the male line. He married, and had a son and a daughter. He
fell under suspicion of the government, and retired abroad about the
year 1588, and died there. His son is stated to have compromised his
claims to the estates with the Howards.</p>

<p>I wish to ascertain, and possibly some of your readers may be able to
state, whom did Francis Dacre marry? What was the name of his son, and
was he married; and the name of his daughter, and whom did she marry;
and whether there are any descendants of this branch of the Dacre family
now in existence?</p>

<p>&mdash;I wish to ascertain the precise etymology
of the word <i>salter</i> as applied to localities far removed from the sea,
and from those districts in which the making of salt is carried on. It
seems to be applied in the north of England to places adjoining ancient
roads, or where these pass: <i>e.g.</i> part of the old highway from Rochdale
to Burnley is called the Salter's Gate. The old road from Rochdale to
Hebden Bridge crosses Salter Edge, on Blackstone Edge. The road from
Rochdale to Middleton crosses Salter Edge in Hopwood. The road from
Ashton to Peniston passes Salter's Brook in the woodlands of Cheshire.
It is somewhat remarkable that all these roads lead in direct lines to

been made, and with what success, to decipher the inscriptions upon the
Lycian monuments in the British Museum. Col. Mure, in his <i>History of
Grecian Literature</i>, vol. i. p. 84., speaks of them as at present
unintelligible. The character, he says, is a variety of the
Græco-Ph&oelig;nician. I find several, if not the greater part, of the
letters in Gesenius's <i>Monumenta Ph&oelig;nicia</i>, especially Tab. 11. and
12. What is the language in which they are written? And if an aboriginal
tongue, over what portion of Asia did the stock to which it belongs
extend in the historical period, and what is that stock? Is it to that
class of dialects that the language of the Gods, as Homer distinguishes
a certain tongue from the language of men, belongs: which called the
"night-jar"
<span title="[Greek: chalkis]">&#967;&#945;&#955;&#954;&#8055;&#962;,</span> named by men

consider these names which the gods use to be the old Pelasgian names,
assured as I feel that the Pelasgi occupied the north-west corner of
Asia Minor before the Greeks (Hellenes) took Troy, which event I have
looked upon as one of many in which the energies and [ ... ] of the
young and vigorous Hellenic family were successfully exerted against
their contemporaries of the other less powerful descendants of the old
Pelasgic settlers in that part of the world. But I shall be thankful for
the information which others wiser than I can give, even if it be but a
theory: accompanied with the <i>facts</i> on which it is based, it will be
worth attention.</p>

occupation? or may its difference from Hebrew and from Arabic be
explained by the circumstances of its history, as having been twice, at
two very different periods, occupied by invaders belonging to two
branches of the same stock? Bochart, <i>Canaan</i>, i. 26., says that the
name "Melete" is Hebrew, meaning <i>refugium</i>; and Diodorus Siculus, v.

<h3>
<span>THE CAXTON MEMORIAL.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 283.)</span>
</h3>

<p>In forming a literary project, whether extensive or otherwise, it is
advisable to keep in view the humble science of arithmetic. Without that
precaution, it may become a source of vexation both to its projector and
its promoters; and, in some cases, the non-completion of it may be a
real injury to literature.</p>

<p>When I proposed a typographic memorial of William Caxton, in preference
to an architectural memorial, and intimated that it might be compressed
into an octavo volume, and produced at a very moderate price, I
flattered myself with having made a more correct estimate than is
commonly made by designers and architects&mdash;Paxton, Cubitt, and Fox,
always excepted&mdash;and I venture to announce, on more mature reflection,
the same decided opinion.</p>

<p>With thanks to M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> B<span class="smcap lowercase">OTFIELD</span> for his enumeration of the translated works
of Caxton, I must remind him that the proposal was a collection of his
<i>original compositions</i>, with <i>specimens of his translations</i>. To
reprint the entire works which proceeded from his press was never my
project. I could not have entertained such an idea for one moment; nor
should I think the realisation of it desirable, even if it could be
effected by magic. I readily admit, however, that I have a liking for
<i>Fayts of armes and chyvalrye</i>&mdash;that <i>Thystorye of Reynard the foxe</i> is
very attractive&mdash;and that the <i>Boke for travellers</i> would be a choice
<i>morçeau philologique</i>.</p>

<p>The publications of Caxton are about sixty in number, and I am sure that
more than six pages would seldom be required for any one work, and that
many articles might be properly treated in less than two pages each. A
short memoir of Caxton, a glossary of obsolete words and phrases, an
appendix of documents, and an index, are the only additions which I
should consider as essential to the completeness of the design. All this
might be comprised in an octavo volume of moderate extent.</p>

<p>The <i>Typographical antiquities</i> of Ames, as augmented by Dibdin, being
the accredited source of information on Caxton, and having misled some
superior writers, I shall presume to deliver my opinion of the <i>first</i>
volume of that work&mdash;not having much acquaintance with the subsequent
volumes. Dibdin had formed, at the very outset, a most injudicious
resolution. Caxton was his hero; and he resolved, as he tells us in his
autobiography, to "devote the first volume entirely to the productions
of his press." In order to carry out this plan, he was led to introduce
much extraneous and useless matter. We have endless repetitions of what
<i>Lewis says</i>, and what <i>Ames says</i>, and what <i>Herbert says</i>, and even
what the dreamer <i>Bagford says</i>, instead of such information as should
have been derived from an examination of the books themselves. Moreover,
he is very deficient in the <i>logic of history</i>, in point of method, and
in point of accuracy; and the extracts, being in modern orthography, are
to philological students UTTERLY WORTHLESS.</p>

<p>This, and perhaps more than this, I may hereafter have occasion to
prove; and should it seem to others that I express myself harshly, due
consideration shall be given to their objections.</p>

<p>I must now assure M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> B<span class="smcap lowercase">OTFIELD</span> that it gives me satisfaction to observe
him somewhat disposed to view my project with favour, and that I am not
less disposed to make such modifications of the<a id="Page_385"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[385]</span> conditions of
publication as may meet the wishes of himself and the other contributors
toward <i>The Caxton Testimonial</i>. Two modes of union suggest themselves,
which I submit to his consideration in the form of queries.</p>

<p>1. If the preparation and impression of the intended volume should be
undertaken by a certain literary society, honourably distinguished by
the substantial character of the works which have been edited under its
sanction, would the committee of <i>The Caxton Testimonial</i> engage to take
a certain number of copies, in case the council of the society alluded
to should assent to such a deviation from its usual course?</p>

<p>2. If this arrangement should be objected to on either side, would the
committee of <i>The Caxton Testimonial</i> undertake to produce a literary
memorial of Caxton on the plan before-described, or not much differing
from it, and under the editorship of persons to be named by themselves?</p>

<p>If neither plan should be approved, I shall not abate <i>one jot of hope</i>
as to the success of the project; but, by permission of the editor of
"N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>," proceed with my humble contributions to <i>The Caxton
Coffer</i>.</p>


  <p class="right">B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLTON</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY.</span></p>


<p>Might not the purpose be attained by the establishment of a club (on the
same principles as the Bannatyne, Maitland, and Spalding Clubs), for the
republication of the works of the first English printer? His works are
of such excessive rarity that they are inaccessible even to the most
devoted antiquary, and indeed many of them are scarcely known even by
name. They are principally thin quartos, and the actual expense of
reprinting them could not be heavy. The only trouble would be in
collating them; and if the matter was once set on foot, we have many
able typographical antiquaries who, I have no doubt, would assist in
editing them. Such a plan appears preferable, because in making the Club
open to any party who chose to pay the agreed-on subscription, it would
thus become better known throughout the kingdom, and consequently stand
a much better chance of support and, of course, success.</p>

<p>The great object of the memorial, in addition to a just recognition of
the important services of Caxton, appears to be to revive his memory;
and this end can only be effectually gained by a republication of his
works, and the plan of a club appears to be the only way by which they
can be extensively circulated.</p>

   carrying out his views he appears to us to have hit upon a very

<p>The words here printed in Italics are in rubric in the original. Then
follows on the title-page a table of contents of the volume, with
reference to the folio in which each piece is to be found.</p>

<p>Then follows a small square woodcut, representing SS. Peter and Paul
holding the sacred handkerchief with the face of Christ impressed upon
it; and on each side of this is the date in rubric, thus,</p>

<p>The whole is surrounded with a framework formed of various woodcut
ornaments. One of these (on the left) represents Judas betraying our
Lord with a kiss; the other (on the right) our Lord bearing His cross.</p>

<p>On the reverse of the title is a dedicatory letter from Iodocus Badius
Ascensius to Franciscus de Roban, Archbishop of Lyons.</p>

<p>Then follows Tabula Alphabetica, occupying four pages.</p>

<p>Then (on fol. A. iiij) a letter, "Aug. Mapheo rer&#363; Ro. Thesaur.
P&#333;p. letus. S." beginning "Marcus Valerius probus unice vetustatis
amator."</p>

<p>On the next page is 'Caij Crispi Sallustij vita per P&#333;po. let&#363;."</p>

<p>On the next page begins "De historia et ea concernentibus collecta per
ascensium;" and in the blanks round the heading of this page is one of
the autographs of the unfortunate queen, in her large bold hand,</p>

   <div class="poem">

<p> <i>Maria</i>  <span class="i11">    <i>Regina</i>.</span></p>

</div>


<p>On the next page begin "Viginti precepta pro historica lege," which are
continued on the next two pages. In the blank spaces left round
the<a id="Page_386"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[386]</span> titles of the ninth and tenth precepta, the queen has again
written,</p>

</div>

<p>On the next leaf begin the works of Sallust, with the commentaries and
other apparatus. The sheets are in eights, so that the book is more
properly large 8<span class="topnum">o</span> than 4<span class="topnum">o</span>, signatures A&mdash;S(but S is only a
half-sheet). The prefatory matter (including the title) is contained on
a single sheet, sig. A, of six leaves only. This is expressed by the
printer's register at the end&mdash;</p>

<p>The colophon has not been completely given by C.; it is as follows:</p>


<p class="blockquot"> "¶ Crispi Sallustii Catilina (<i>sic</i>) et Jugurthina cum reliquis

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn6"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#chard6" class="label">[6]</a> Not
 Blanchard, as C. has printed the name.</p>

<p>These particulars may enable your readers to identify this edition,
which is, I believe, very rare.</p>

<p>After the colophon are two pages occupied by remarks on Sallust by
"Jacobus a cruce Bononiensis:" leaving the last page in the volume
blank, except that in the centre is a woodcut of larger size than that
already mentioned, which is on the title-page, but representing the same
subject, viz. SS. Peter and Paul holding the sacred handkerchief.</p>

<p>On the upper right-hand corner of this last page are the verses quoted
by C., and correctly quoted, except that <i>meæ</i> and <i>puellæ</i> in the first
line are <i>mee</i> and <i>puelle</i> in the original.</p>

<p>There is not the smallest shadow of probability for supposing these
verses, or any of the other MS. annotations which occur in the volume,
to be in the handwriting of Mary Queen of Scots. She wrote a large and
not by any means a scholarlike hand, which is very well known; whereas
these verses and the other annotations, are in a small and crampt
scholarlike hand of the sixteenth century, as unlike the handwriting of
Mary as any that can be imagined. In fact I was not aware, until I read
C.'s letter in "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>," that anybody had ever supposed it to
be hers.</p>

<p>The note recording the donation of this book by James I. to Bishop Hall,
occurs fol. xc. It is in a large schoolboylike hand, and is correctly
quoted by C.</p>

<p>The book contains numerous woodcuts, which have no discoverable relation
to the text, and are inserted merely to mark the commencement of the
books, or different pieces of which the volume consists. Many of these
are repeated several times.</p>

<p>The ornamental letter to which C. refers is the letter O, the first in
the book. The grotesque character of it noticed by C. would not be
easily observed except it were specially pointed out. C. may be assured
that it was not particularly pointed out to Her Majesty when she did us
the honour of inspecting this and some other literary treasures of our
library in 1849.</p>

<h3>
<span>STANZAS IN CHILDE HAROLD.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 223. 285. 323.)</span>
</h3>


<p>I trust that a few words more will not be deemed overmuch in pointing
out what I think will be found to be the source of T. W.'s difficulty.
We need not go to French or German translators, because it is reasonable
to suppose that where any sense can be made out of the text as it
stands, the last thing a foreigner would do would be to complete an
elliptical expression. I agree with M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLLINS</span>, who says the expression
"is very good sense;" and from his adding "much more Byronic," I expect
he will agree with me in adding also, "but very bad taste." T. W. seems
to have felt this; and nothing can be more conclusive than his criticism
upon this point. I trust that there are few men of taste who have not as
utter an abhorrence of tyranny as Lord Byron; but I think that, strongly
as men of genius may be supposed to feel, few would have lugged in the
tyrants on such an occasion; as it seems to me it was just in the nature
of the noble poet, with or without cause, to do. What Byron says is
perfectly true; it is simply out of place: nevertheless, as the text
stands, it is said with force. But adopt T. W.'s variation, and can a
<i>flatter</i> truism be conceived? And, after all, the objection not
removed; for the allusion would be equally out of place: unless, indeed,
your correspondent could make out of the text that</p>

<div class="poem">

  <p>"Thy waters wasted them while they were free,"</p>
  <p>    And <i>wasted them</i>, <i>afterwards</i>, during their slavery,</p>
  <p>Or, has continued <i>to waste them since</i>.</p>

</div>


  <p class="right"> S<span class="smcap lowercase">AMUEL</span> H<span class="smcap lowercase">ICKSON.</span></p>



<p>I will not dwell on T. W.'s last remarks about Byron's "Address to the
Ocean," farther than to observe, that it is difficult to conceive how he
can understand the French translation which he quotes, in such a way
that it shall tally with the view which he has put forward. The
translation says, "the waves wasted their shores in the days of liberty,
as they have done since under many a tyrant." This is very different
from making the line mean either "the waves wasted the tyrants,"<a id="Page_387"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[387]</span>
as T. W. thinks it means with Byron's punctuation, or "the shores obey
the tyrants," as T. W. would make it mean with his <i>amended</i>
punctuation.</p>

<p>In a recent number (p. 325.) M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> M. C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLLINS</span> objects to&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

   <p>   "Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in <i>vain</i>!"</p>

</div>

<p>and exclaims, "<i>In vain!</i>" Why, did not Columbus, &amp;c.? But this
criticism also overlooks the meaning of the passage. The fleets traverse
the ocean quite in vain, as to producing any permanent traces, as is
explained in the very next words:</p>

   <p>  "Man marks <i>the earth</i> with ruin: his control</p>
  <p>    Stops with the shore," &amp;c.</p>

<h3>
<span>CAGOTS.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 190. 331.)</span>
</h3>

<p>A reference to Dr. Guggenbühl's <i>Letter to Lord Ashley on Cretinism</i>,
and to the reviews of the subject, of which I can name two in the
<i>Athenæum</i>, one in 1848, p. 1077., and another on June 21, 1851, will, I
think, show that there are no "races of Cretins," though the
disease&mdash;for it is nothing but a disease&mdash;will sometimes largely affect
even families. One of the principal characteristics of the disease is a
disgusting goître, enlarging the neck to such a size, that a part of it
becomes pendulous to the length of upwards of a foot, and can even be
flung over the shoulder, and is, indeed, often carried there. It is very
commonly accompanied by idiocy; and, in fact, the Cretin is one of the
most distressing objects that can be seen. The disease is very common in
some parts of Switzerland, especially, I believe, the Valais; some
attribute it to the water: and probably climatic influences, in
conjunction with the deleterious elements contained in the water, and
the frequent intermarriage of the villagers, and deficient or
unwholesome diet, are the chief sources to which it must be traced. It
is curable; at the institution on the Abendberg the treatment is very
successful. The disease never appears above a certain level, and
disappears when, under favourable circumstances, the patient is raised
to that level. Cases have been found in Lancashire, and at Chiselborough
in Somersetshire, and at other places which present predisposing causes
resembling those of Switzerland.</p>

<p>I do not think that A<span class="smcap lowercase">JAX'S</span> suggestion "credentes" as the derivation of
Cretin can be substantiated. Is it a term at all connected with
diversity of religious opinion and consequent persecution? In the Alps,
Cretinism is regarded with pity and kindness,
 as R<span class="smcap lowercase">USTICUS</span> truly remarks.
The term <i>cagot</i> is current in the French with the meaning of an
impostor, a hypocrite; "celui qui a une dévotion fausse ou
mal-entendue," is the meaning in the <i>Dictionnaire de l'Académie</i>; also
a bigot.</p>

<p>It is altogether a religious term. May I suggest that they are a relique
of the old population of the mountain vallies imperfectly Christianised,
therefore despised by the more enlightened population of the
neighbourhood,&mdash;half-civilised, perhaps, and physically degraded by the
same causes which have given the goître and the idiocy of the Cretin to
the inhabitants of the Valais. If so, they may be Iberian, or what is
commonly called Celtiberian, a term which I think there is reason for
abandoning. I shall be glad to hear more of these <i>Cagots</i>; about the
Cretins a good deal is known, and with much certainty, but nothing, as
far as I can learn, that tends to identify them historically with any
religious sect.</p>

<p>I am able to add further information concerning the <i>Cagots</i>. They are a
miserable race, mostly beggars, or employed only about the meanest and
filthiest work, abounding in leprosy and other cutaneous diseases, and
in the most loathsome vermin; houseless, half-clad, inhabiting stables,
barns, or any casual place of shelter, generally mutilated and lame,
outcasts from society, reputed to lead infamous lives, indulging in the
most horrible practices, even of cannibalism, and worse offences than
that. Their brand used to be an eggshell on their clothes, and the
custom was to pierce their feet with an iron. Scaliger derived their
name from "Canis Gottus," and their origin has been assigned to some one
of the northern nations which penetrated into the south of France and
north of Spain in the third and fourth centuries before our era.</p>

<p>On this may I be allowed to forward a Query or two? What is their
language? What are their own traditions concerning their origin? I am
confirmed in my opinion that they are no way analogous to the Cretins;
the latter being diseased, and Cretins because they are diseased; the
<i>Cagot</i> being diseased and filthy, and despised because he is a <i>Cagot</i>,
an individual of a degraded and outcast race of men.</p>

<h3>
<span>TEXTS BEFORE SERMONS.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 344.)</span>
</h3>


<p>In the early church the sermon was delivered immediately after the
reading of the Scriptures (<i>Const. Apost.</i> lib. viii. c. 5.), and
sometimes preached without any text; at other times, upon more texts
than one; but most commonly the text was taken out of some paragraph of
the Psalms or Lessons, as they were read. Origen expressly calls
Sermons, <i>explanations of the Lessons</i> (Orig. <i>cont. Cels.</i>, lib. iii.).
The Fathers sometimes so ordered the matter, as to preach upon the
Psalm, the Epistle, and the Gospel all together, when they happened to
be on<a id="Page_388"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[388]</span> the same subject. Thus St. Augustine (<i>Serm.</i> x. t. x. p.
112.) preached upon the subject of praise and thanksgiving, out of the
Epistle, the Psalm, and the Gospel together, because they each had
something relating to his subject. (<i>Bingham</i>, book xiv. ch. iv. § 17.)
This may have given rise to the present plan of textual preaching.
During the middle ages we frequently meet with the terms <i>postilla</i>,
<i>postillæ</i>, <i>postillare</i>, and the like (from <i>post illa verba Scripturæ
sacræ</i>), denoting sometimes merely expositions of Scripture, and
sometimes popular discourses founded upon a passage just before read.</p>

<p>In England, about the year 957, Elfric, afterwards Archbishop of
Canterbury, required the priest in each parish to explain the Gospel of
the day, the Creed, and the Lord's Prayer, on Sundays and holydays.
(Canon <span class="smcap lowercase">XXIII.</span> Ælfrica, Wilkins, <i>Concil.</i> tom. i. p. 253.) The same
person afterwards compiled Homilies in the Anglo-Saxon language, which
for some time continued to be read in the English Church. (Cave,
<i>Historia Literaria</i>, tom. ii.)</p>

<p>During the reign of King John, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1204, the custom of preaching from
a text appears to have originated with Stephen Langton, Archbishop of
Canterbury, and adopted by some of the divines of the University of
Oxford. The practice, however, met with some opposition by the sages and
seniors of that seat of learning, as related by the author [Sir John
Peshall] of <i>The History of the University of Oxford, from the Death of
William the Conqueror to the Demise of Queen Elizabeth</i>, 4to. 1773, p.
7.:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "The ancient practice of explaining considerable portions of
   Scripture first showed itself openly in this University. This was
   to name a thesis or text from the Scripture, and make divisions
   upon it; which method is said to have been adopted by Stephen
   Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, who therefore divided the
   Scriptures into chapters. The people at their religious
   assemblies much approved of this way, in preference to the raw
   discourses of young and ignorant preachers. Yet others, rejecting
   new customs and innovations, chose to follow their old way, which
   was that of the Saints Austin, Jerome, Barnard, &amp;c.; and Robert
   Grostest, D.D. (whose word was a law with the university), was
   among the opposers. This was <i>postillando</i>, i.e. by expounding
   the words of Scripture as they stood in order, by inferences
   drawn from them. They took no text, but began in this manner: 'I
   intend, by the grace of God, in my following discourse, to treat
   of certain matters; and in these matters I intend to draw certain
   and true conclusions, for I intend now to speak of the fear of
   God. First, concerning fear,' &amp;c. And so far down as the
   fifteenth century this kind of preaching continued: for so
   Vascanius, doctor and chancellor of the university, relates of
   himself: 'Anno 1450, in the octaves of St. John the Evangelist,
   on the Lord's Day, I showed in my sermon, preached at Oxford, in
   St. Martin's Church at Carfax, that Dr. Augustine preached four
   hundred sermons to the clergy and people without any thesis, and
   without taking a text at the beginning of his discourse. And so I
   (says he) preached the day and year above mentioned, in Oxford,
   by taking no theme or text; but I administered to the people
   profitable matters, without repeating of any text, but only words
   pertinent to matters proposed or declared.'"</p>


<p>The ancient practice of explaining considerable portions of Scripture to
the people was revived by our reformers. Before them Colet had employed
many years in publicly expounding all the Epistles of St. Paul.
Archbishop Cranmer expounded Hebrews; as Bishops Hooper, Latimer, and
Jewel, did Jonah, the Lord's Prayer, many of the Epistles, and all the
Epistles and Gospels on Sundays and holydays.</p>


<p class="blockquot">"From the practice of Ambrose, Origen, Chrysostom, and Austin,
   among the ancients, and of our reformers, and more modern
   divines, we may safely affirm (says Mr. Shepherd in his
   <i>Elucidation of the Morning and Evening Prayer</i>) that explaining
   and applying portions of Scripture read in the Lessons, is a very
   beneficial mode of preaching to ordinary congregations."</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Gay (1.) was a scholar of Peter Blundell's foundation, and in
   1724 succeeded to a fellowship on the same foundation. This
   fellowship, of which there are two at this college, is tenable
   for ten years; and all our fellows are compelled to proceed
   regularly to the degree of B.D. (seven years after they have
   taken that of M.A.). Mr. Gay was M.A. in 1725, and might have
   proceeded to B.D. in 1732: but he never took any higher degree
   than M.A. He must therefore have vacated his fellowship before
   1732. I find no mention of his name in our College Office-book
   later than 7th May, 1730. He was probably presented during that
   year to the vicarage of Wilshamstead (which of course would
   render void his fellowship), and subsequently entered upon
   another kind of fellowship, one of the results of which was Gay
   (3.).</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Of Gay (2.) I find it recorded that he was appointed Chapel
   Clerk in 1719; that he was B.A. 1722, and M.A. 1731. As far as
   dates are concerned, it might be questioned which of the brothers
   (1. or 2.) was the author of the 'Preliminary Dissertation.' In
   our University Library I can find only two editions of Law's
   translation of Archbishop King's work, viz. the 2nd edit., 1732,
   which contains the 'Preliminary Dissertation,' but no mention of
   its author; and the 4th edit., Camb. 1758, at the end of the
   Preface to which are these words: 'The following Dissertation was
   composed chiefly by the <i>late</i> Rev. Mr. Gay.' The author of the
   Dissertation must therefore have died in or before 1758. But in
   the entry of Gay (4.) 1762 (who was without doubt nephew of 1.),
   I do not find 'defuncti' attached to his father's name, which it
   has always been usual to add, in the case of the father being
   deceased.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"I am convinced in my own mind that the Mr. Gay of Sidney
   College, mentioned by Paley in his life of Bishop Law, was Gay
   (1.). There would be no difficulty, I should think, in
   ascertaining the time of Mr. John Gay's decease. The present
   vicar of Wilshamstead could no doubt readily inform you. If it
   should be found that Mr. John Gay died before 1758, then there
   can be no question but that he is Bishop Law's <i>late</i> Mr. Gay.</p>

<h3>
<span>VERMIN, PAYMENTS FOR DESTRUCTION OF, AND ANCIENT NAMES.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 208.)</span>
</h3>

<p>The 8 Eliz. c. 15. and 14 Eliz. c. 11. provide that in every parish the
churchwardens with six other parishioners shall yearly on one of the
holydays in Easter week, and at every other time when needful, tax and
assess every land and tithe-owner within the parish to pay such sums of
money as they shall think meet according to the quantity of such their
lands or tithes, and on nonpayment thereof within fourteen days after
demand to forfeit five shillings, which, together with the sum assessed
shall be levied by distress on the goods and chattels of such land or
tithe-owner; and as well the said sums as penalties shall be delivered
to two honest and substantial persons of the parish eligible by the
churchwardens, to be named "The distribution of the provisions for the
destruction of noisome fowl and vermin." Such is the authority required
by J. B. (Manchester), by which churchwardens in old times paid sums of
money for the destruction of vermin in the several parishes of England.
It will, however, be observed that their authority was not confined to
"vermin," but extended to the "fowls of the air;" and the "old volumes
of churchwardens' accounts," to which your correspondent has access,
amply testify to the fact that those churchwardens were fully alive to
their duty, powers, and authority, under the above-named statutes;
inasmuch as two, at least, of the <i>ancient names</i> belong to the
<i>feathered tribe</i>; <i>glead</i> being identical with <i>kite</i>, and <i>ringteal</i>
or <i>ringtail</i> (<i>subbuteo</i>) with a species of <i>hawk</i>, in some districts
more commonly called the <i>hobby</i>. <i>Greas' head</i> I must leave to some
other <i>head</i> to determine, unless indeed is meant the <i>great-shrike</i> or
<i>butcher-bird</i> belonging to the same order (<i>accipitres</i>) as the <i>kite</i>
and <i>ringtail</i> or <i>hobby</i>. Notwithstanding J. B.'s diffidence, I am much
inclined to adopt his surmise, that the worthy churchwarden really
intended <i>badger</i> when he wrote <i>baggar</i>.</p>


<p class="right">F<span class="smcap lowercase">RANCISCUS.</span></p>




<p>It is hardly so impossible to identify the animals mentioned by your
correspondent J. B. as he supposes. <i>Glead</i> is the A.-S. <i>glida</i> or
<i>kite</i>, though, in our version of Deut. xiv. 13., both <i>glede</i> and
<i>kite</i> are mentioned. <i>Ringteal</i> or <i>ringtail</i> is the female of the
<i>Circus cyaneus</i> or hen-harrier, another species of falcon. <i>Greas'
head</i> and <i>baggar</i> refer to the same animal (the badger), for there is
no wonder that a scribe who writes <i>greas' head</i> for <i>gray's head</i>
should write also <i>baggar</i> for <i>badger</i>. This latter animal has a
variety of names by which he is known in one and the same district, e.g.
<i>gray</i> or <i>graye</i>, <i>bawson</i> or <i>bowson</i>, <i>brock</i> and <i>badger</i>, and in
<i>our</i> churchwardens' accounts these names occur indiscriminately. I hope
some one will be able to point out the origin of paying for the
destruction of these animals out of the parochial funds; I have
frequently searched without success such authorities as I have access
to. The earliest entry of the kind in the books of this parish (which
date from 1520) is in 1583.<a id="Page_390"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[390]</span></p>

<p>I subjoin a few extracts, which afford a curious instance of the
respective prices put upon the heads of these animals at a time when
such entries occur; as,</p>

<p>These entries are very numerous in our books with every variety of
spelling, though the prices remain very much the same. I have found no
entries of the kind after 1744, but that may be owing to the accounts
being not entered fully in every case after that period; but I cannot
agree with J. B. in his assertion that these animals are now considered
innocuous; witness the vulgar error with regard to the hedgehog's
sucking the teats of cows, an error which no process of reasoning can
induce the farmers about here to renounce; moreover, I know for a fact
that not more than a dozen years ago the farmers near Wakefield used to
give a halfpenny per head for every unlucky sparrow (fledged or
unfledged) that was brought to them by any bird-nesting youngster.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE CLAIMS OF LITERATURE.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 337.)</span>
</h3>

<p>There is the more pressing need, in our day, of an <i>Order of Victoria</i>,
or <i>of Civil Merit</i>&mdash;such as you justly and feelingly contend for and
describe in the "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>"&mdash;from the great and increasing
numbers of our literary and scientific men, who are acutely sensible of
the undeserved stigma and ban under which they lie, by being often
excluded from the intellectual society so congenial to them, owing to
their not possessing some recognised badge of honour and passport in
life, equivalent to the degrees or distinctions so justly conferred upon
those who have studied at our Universities, or are awarded to men who
have won eminence in the Naval, Military, or Civil Service of the Crown.
An honourable title, proceeding from the Sovereign herself, and bestowed
alike on <i>both sexes</i> (for who would think&mdash;certainly not our beloved
Queen&mdash;of wounding the delicate female mind by excluding a Somerville, a
Hannah More, a Joanna Baillie, or a Felicia Hemans&mdash;the three latter not
needing now our poor applause&mdash;from the cheering honours due to their
genius, their talents, and their virtues?) would be a fitting tribute
from a British, a Christian Monarch to that intellectual superiority and
moral worth which are the immortal distinctions of our race. At present
many individuals who have raised themselves by their native force of
mind and acquirements to a position of honour and respectability as
literary and scientific men, are yet looked upon and treated as pariahs
by those who are the bestowers and guardians of national distinctions.
The just pride and self-respect of such men will forbid their courting,
by any unworthy advances, an introduction to society, from which, by
their position, they stand excluded; and it would be a truly royal
exercise of her sovereign rights, for Queen Victoria to extend, beyond
the present line of demarcation, the barriers that now prevent those
from meeting together, who, if they were better acquainted, would learn
to value and esteem each other: while society at large would be an
immense gainer in all its relations&mdash;scientific, literary, and
artistic&mdash;by the honours and distinctions thus conferred upon a most
worthy, but most contemned and neglected portion of the educated
community.</p>

<span><i>Arbor Lowe&mdash;Stanton Moor&mdash;Ayre Family</i></span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 274.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In
Rhodes's <i>Peak Scenery</i>, p. 228, it is said:</p>


<p class="blockquot">"Near Middleton, by Youlgrave, we found the celebrated Druidical
   monument of Arbor Low, one of the most striking remains of
   antiquity in any part of Derbyshire. This circle includes an area
   of from forty to fifty yards diameter, formed by a series of
   large unhewn stones, not standing upright, but all laid on the
   ground, with an inclination towards the centre; round these the
   remains of a ditch, circumscribed by a high embankment, may be
   traced. Near the south entrance into this circle there is a
   mound, or burial-place, in which some fragments of an urn, some
   half-burnt bones, and the horns of a stag, were found."</p>


<p>In the same work, at pages 236, 237., is an account of the Druidical
remains at Stanton Moor. And at page 224. are the following remarks:&mdash;</p>


 <p class="blockquot">"The Eyres is one of the oldest families in Derbyshire, where
   they have continued to reside through the long lapse of more than
   seven hundred years, as appears from the following curious
   extract from an old pedigree which is preserved at Hassop. 'The
   first of the Eyres came in with King William the Conqueror, and
   his name was Truelove; but in the battle of Hastings (14 Oct.
   1066) this Truelove, seeing the king unhorsed,<a id="Page_391"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[391]</span> and his
   helmet beat so close that he could not breathe, pulled off his
   helmet and horsed him again. The king said, Thou shalt hereafter
   from Truelove be called <i>Air</i> or <i>Eyre</i>, because thou hast given
   me the air I breathe. After the battle the king called for him,
   and being found with his thigh cut off, he ordered him to be
   taken care of; and being recovered, he gave him lands in the
   county of Derby, in reward for his services, and the seat he
   lived at he called Hope, because he had hope in the greatest
   extremity; and the king gave the leg and thigh cut off in armour
   for his crest, and which is still the crest of all the Eyres in
   England.'"</p>


<p>A descendant of this person is the present Earl of Newburgh, of Hassop
Hall.</p>

<p>At page 240. is an account of the village of Birchover, and also of the
Rowter Rocks, but no mention is made of the family of the Ayres, or of
the ruins of any house formerly belonging to them.</p>

<p>&mdash;The paragraph
quoted by S<span class="smcap lowercase">IR</span> F. M<span class="smcap lowercase">ADDEN</span> out of <i>Prayers after the confession of sins,
and the sense of pardon obtained</i>, and well called by him "striking," is
a <i>verbatim</i> copy of a passage in "A Guide for the Penitent," published
at the end of Jeremy Taylor's <i>Golden Grove</i>.</p>

<p>The short preface, by a nameless hand, which precedes this division of
the <i>Golden Grove</i>, would lead one to suppose that "A Guide for the
Penitent" was a posthumous work of Jeremy Taylor; but this is not
exactly stated. The prayers, however, have the same spirit and grandeur
of piety which characterise those which are the acknowledged
compositions of Bishop Taylor. Monmouth was beheaded eighteen years
after Taylor died. It would be interesting to identify the author of "A
Guide for the Penitent" (should there be any doubt on the subject):
also, to ascertain how far Monmouth <i>quoted</i>, in his "prayers," from
Taylor or any other divine.</p>

<p>&mdash;Your
correspondent T. T., in reply to my Query respecting this work, says
(Vol. iv., p. 328.) that it "was printed in Venice, 1538, in 4to." This
is impossible: for the elder Buxtorf was born in 1564; and it would be
singular if he had translated R. Elias' work, and printed it at Venice,
twenty-six years before he was born.</p>

<p>T. T. seems not to have observed that my inquiry related to Buxtorf's
<i>translation</i>, not to the original work of Elias Levita, which, although
now rare, is sufficiently well known to Rabbinical scholars. I must
therefore renew my inquiry (Vol. iv., p. 272.): has Buxtorf's

from even a greater poet than Homer. See Psalm lxxx. verses 8 to 13
(Common Prayer Version), and the context before and following, which
contains perhaps the most picturesque and beautiful, as well as
practical, allegory in the compass even of sacred literature. "The wild

appear to me to have any reference to the iconoclastic propensities of
the person addressed. But this notice of your correspondent is

<span><i>Anecdote of Curran</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iv., p. 173.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;This anecdote, I beg to
observe, is incorrectly represented; and surely presents to the reader
no adequate provocation for the sharp retort on him attributed to the
hostess, on his offering her a glass of wine. But the fact is, that the
circumstance occurred, not at a small country inn, but in the city of
Galway; nor solely in company with a brother advocate, as stated by
M.W.B., but at the general bar-mess. The Connaught circuit was not
Curran's, who had been called there <i>specially</i>, and who, having heard
of the barmaid's ready wit, was determined to test it. Her name, I well
recollect, was Honor Slaven; and her quick repartee to the not very
delicate jokes constantly practised on her by the gentlemen (?) of the
bar, had spread her fame beyond the province. Curran, however, was far
superior to those whom she had foiled in these too often unseemly
combats, and was expected to prove that superiority in this contest.
Among the customary toasts of that time was a succession of three
alliterative ones, of which the last was of flagrant indecency; and this
Curran resolved should fall to Honor's turn to<a id="Page_392"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[392]</span> give in due
rotation. Making her take a seat, with one interposed between them, he
began with the first:&mdash;"Honor (directing himself to <i>her</i>) and Honesty,"
followed by "Love and Loyalty" from his next neighbour; when, ordering a
bumper, he said, "Come Honor, you know the next toast; be not squeamish,
and let us have it." "No, Sir," replied she, with an arch smile, "but I
will pledge you in your own toast&mdash;'Honor and Honesty, or, <i>your absent
friends</i>.'" These last words were uttered with special emphasis, and, in
their provoked application, well sustained the barmaid's reported
character; as, indeed, promptly acknowledged by Curran himself. I have
more than once heard similar retorts from her when thus assailed.</p>

<span><i>The Monumental Inscriptions of the Bourchier Family</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 233.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Your inquirer L. M. M. will most probably meet with the
information he desires in the county of Essex, of which portion of the
kingdom they were Earls, and held immense possessions from the early
part of the fourteenth to the sixteenth century. Their principal estates
were in the parishes of Moreton, Tollesbury, Chingford, Little Laver,
Greensted, Ramsden, South Church, Wakering, Maldon, North Farnbridge,
Lachingdon, Mayland, Langford, Great Totham, Bentley, Wickes, Tendring,
Great Holland, Beaumont, Ramsey, Bromfield, Rivenhall, Halsted,
Hanningfield, Chicknall, Ulting, Messing, Hedingham Sibil, Ballington,
Foxearth, Belchamp, Toppesfield, Braintree, Little Easton, Chickney;
Broxted, Roding Aythorp, Little Hallingbury, Walden, and Farnham. In all
these parishes they held manors, with the advowsons of several of the
churches. Many of the manors are called after the family, <i>Bourchier's
Hall</i>; some members of the family were buried in Bilegh Abbey, which
stood in the west part of the town of Maldon. In Halsted they founded a
chantry for a master and eight priests; and adjoining Little Easton
church still remains a fine chapel, known as Bourchier's chapel, where
there are tombs to some of the family in fine preservation. By a visit
to the churches of the parishes above enumerated, much information may
probably be obtained, for there can be little doubt but so powerful a
family were great benefactors to the churches of the several parishes
where their estates and mansions were situated; and most probably many
members of the family were interred in them, and had tombs to their
memory.</p>

placing the bow across a piece of stout timber made for the purpose, and
hanging weights to the string till it reaches about twenty-seven or
twenty-eight inches. The weight necessary to do this determines the
power of the bow.</p>

binding, which in the gilt <i>lettering</i> on the back, states it to be by
<i>Ed. Wigorn</i>. This reminds me of another similar <i>naïveté</i>. When the

<span><i>Yankee Doodle</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 344.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;During the attacks upon the French
outposts in 1755 in America, Governor Shirley and General Jackson led
the force directed against the enemy lying at Niagara and Frontenac. In
the early part of June, whilst these troops were stationed on the banks
of the Hudson, near Albany, the descendants of the "Pilgrim fathers"
flocked in from the eastern provinces; never was seen such a motley
regiment as took up its position on the left wing of the British army.
The band played music some two centuries of age, officers and privates
had adopted regimentals each man after his own<a id="Page_393"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[393]</span> fashion; one wore
a flowing wig, while his neighbour rejoiced in hair cropped closely to
the head; this one had a coat with wonderful long skirts, his fellow
marched without his upper garment; various as the colours of the rainbow
were the clothes worn by the gallant band. It so happened that there was
a certain Dr. Shuckburgh, wit, musician, and surgeon, and one evening
after mess he produced a tune, which he earnestly commended as a
well-known piece of military music, to the officers of the militia. The
joke succeeded, and Yankee Doodle was hailed by acclamation "their own
march." During the unhappy war between the American colonies and the
mother country, that quaint merry tune animated the soldiers of
Washington; it is now the national air of the United States.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>General Wolfe</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., pp. 271. 323.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Some of the inquiries made
at p. 271. respecting General Wolfe have been subsequently answered, I
find, in p. 323., but no mention appears of his family beyond his father
and mother; a deficiency which I can in some degree supply by ascending
to his great-grandfather, Captain George Wo<i>u</i>lfe (sic), of whom we are
told by Ferrar, in his <i>History of Limerick</i>, there printed by A.
Watson, in 1787,&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"That on the capitulation of the city of Limerick in October,
   1651, to the Parliamentarian general Ireton, twenty of the most
   distinguished of its defenders were excepted from pardon, and
   reserved for execution. Amongst them were two brothers, George
   and Francis Woulfe: the former, a military officer; the latter, a
   friar, who was hanged,&mdash;but the captain made his escape. He
   fled," says Ferrar (p. 350.), "to the north of England, where he
   settled; and his grandson, General Edward Woulfe, was appointed
   colonel of the 8th regiment of foot in the year 1745. He
   transmitted his virtues with additional lustre to his son
   Major-General James Woulfe, whose memory will be for ever dear to
   his country, and whose name will be immortalised in history."</p>


<p>Captain Woulfe married, and changed his religion; to which his brother
the friar fell a martyr, exhibiting on the scaffold, it is related, far
more intrepidity than many of his fellow sufferers of military rank.
Ireton, however, finally pardoned several of those originally excepted
from the capitulation. Woulfe's family was at that period one of the
most eminent in the county of Clare, where it still retains a
respectable rank; and one of its members was the late Chief Baron,
Stephen Woulfe, a gentleman equally beloved in society as respected on
the bench. Another was a chemist of some eminence in London, at the
close of the past century. They retained the <i>u</i> in the name, which most
others, like the captain's descendants, laid aside; as Bonaparte did
during his triumphant campaign in Italy, in order to un-Italianise and
Frenchify his patronymic B<i>u</i>onaparte. The Chief Justice Wolfe, who was
so barbarously murdered in Dublin at the outbreak of young Emmet's
rebellion in 1803, was of a different branch. Edward, the general's
father, had distinguished himself under Marlborough, as did the son in
1747, at the battle of Lawfelst on the continent. My own family, I may
add, has been brought into close connexion with that of the subsisting
Irish branch of the general's stock by intermarriage.</p>

reference to the original edition, not much valued indeed as very
imperfect, he said, that though now rare, because long, as not worth

conclude, of course, that it is not there; but if he authorises M.
Renouard's son, who resides in the <i>Rue Garancière</i>, or any respectable
bookseller, to provide the little volume for him, I feel confident of
his success. Nor do I apprehend that the price will correspond with its
rarity, like the works of so many other writers; such even as the
prophecies of Merlin, as stated in the article referred to by
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> D<span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> S<span class="smcap lowercase">T.</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ROIX</span>, without recurring to our Shakspeare's early editions, or to those
of Ariosto, Cervantes, Boccacio, Molière, Froissart, Le Roman de la
Rose, Amadis de Gaule, the <i>Romances of Chivalry</i> in various languages,
and the editiones principes of the classics, &amp;c. &amp;c., a comparison of
the value of which two centuries or less ago, as we find them in old
catalogues, with their present cost, so strikes the reader. Numerous
books, on the other hand, have experienced a proportionally equal
depreciation:</p>

<span><i>Expressions in Milton</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iii., p. 241.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;If this Query has already
met with an answer, my apology for troubling you with this must be, that
it has escaped my notice.</p>

<p>R. is undoubtedly right in supposing that a "toothed sleck stone" means
a toothed or jagged whetstone; the word <i>sleck</i> preserving a greater
resemblance to its Danish cousin <i>slecht</i> than the modern <i>slick</i>.</p>

<p>For "bullish," Milton shall be his own interpreter. "I affirm it to be a
<i>bull, taking away the essence of that which it calls itself</i>."</p>

<p>The phrase "bid you the base" is apparently taken from the old game of
Prisoner's Base, for which, if necessary, reference may be made to the
<i>Boy's Own Book</i>. I am inclined to think that the very phrase was, in my
school days, used in the game; but if wrong in any remembrance, I may
still be right in my conjecture, and then the phrase would be equivalent
to, "I challenge you to follow me," as one boy follows another in
Prisoner's Base; and we should then have a curious illustration of the
antiquity of the game.</p>

<span>"<i>A little Bird told me</i>" </span>
<span>(Vol. iv. p. 232.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The following are merely
a few rough notes made from time to time on this saying. I have tried to
put them into some kind of order but they are too trivial, and too
easily verified by reference, to deserve more space in print than they
have hitherto had in writing:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Last lines of <i>King Henry IV.</i> Part II., and Steevens's note.</p>

<p>2. The "pious lie" of Mahomet's pigeon. See Gibbon, <i>Decline and Fall</i>,
chap. 1. Marg. lemma&mdash;"His character," the note beginning&mdash;"The
Christians, rashly enough," &amp;c. And&mdash;"Life of Mahomet" [<i>Library of
Useful Knowledge</i>] note on p. 19. For line from&mdash;<i>Dunciad</i>&mdash;[a slovenly
reference] see book iv. 358.</p>

<p>3. From the Greek? See Potter's <i>Gr. Antiquities</i>, book ii. chap.
xv.&mdash;or Robinson's <i>Antiq. Greece</i>, book iii. chap. xv. <i>ad init.</i> as
both refer to <i>Aristoph. Aves.</i> [600. 601. Bekker.]</p>

<p>4. <i>Ecclesiastes</i>, chap. x. 20.</p>

<p>To these I may add the origin assigned to the saying by Mr. Bellenden
Ker, in his <i>Essay on the Archæology of our Popular Phrases and Nursery
Rhymes</i>, 1837, vol. i. p. 63., viz.:&mdash;</p>


<p class="i5"> <span class="smaller">"A LITTLE BIRD.</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"A good humoured way of replying to, <i>who told you this story?</i>
   And imparting you don't mean to inform him, that you have a good
   reason for not letting him know. <i>Er lij t'el baerd</i>; q. e. <i>by

<span><i>Mark of Reference in Bible</i> </span>

shape?</p>

<p>For the purpose of expounding the law in the Jewish assemblies, the
Pentateuch was divided into fifty-four sections (on account of the
intercalary year), that the whole might be read over once annually. The
sections were distinguished, as they still continue to be, in the Hebrew
copies, by the letter <i>Pe</i>, or <i>Phe</i>, the initial of <i>Pharasha</i>, which
signifies separation or division. This probably was the original reason
for adopting the inverted black P [¶] which is retained in our
translation of the Bible to mark paragraphs or transitions. The division
of the Old and New Testament into chapters is a modern practice, and the
subdivision of chapters into verses still more modern. See Shepherd on
the <i>Morning and Evening Prayer</i>.</p>

Walpole threatens vengeance for the dismissal of Conway;
 and C<span class="smcap lowercase">LERICUS</span>
concludes by asking, "If these extracts do not <i>prove</i> Horace Walpole to
be Junius, &amp;c., &amp;c., <i>what can</i> he allude to?" Why, to the pamphlet

<p>&mdash;I suspect H. E. has not read his seal
quite correctly. I surmise it is <i>Fermelioduni</i>. However, no doubt
Dunferline is meant; and the literal translation of the legend is, "Seal
of the city of Dunferline." This place was a royal burgh, with a palace;
and the word <i>civitas</i> was not then confined to towns which were

and I doubt not but that it is still to be seen there.</p>

<p>It is of oak, and stands upon a pillar and base like those of a small

<h4>
<span><i>Lord Hungerford</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 345.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The story of the device of a
toad having been introduced into the armorial bearings of the
Hungerfords, in memory of the degradation of some member of the family,
is, in every way, nonsensical. "Argent, three toads sable" is certainly
one of their old quarterings; as may be seen upon one of the monuments
in the chapel at Farleigh Castle near Bath. But it was borne by the
Hungerfords for a very different reason. Robert, the second Lord, who
died <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1459, had married the wealthy heiress of the Cornish family of
<i>Botreaux</i>: and this has one of the shields used by <i>her</i> family, being
in fact nothing more than an allusion, not uncommon in heraldry, to the
name. This was spelled variously, <i>Botreaux</i> or <i>Boterelles</i>: and the
device was probably assumed from the similarity of the name of the old
French word <i>Botterol</i>, a toad: (see Cotgrave) or the old Latin word
<i>Botterella</i>. The marriage with the Botreaux heiress and the assumption
of her arms, having taken place <i>many years before</i> any member of the
Hungerford family was attainted or executed (as some of them afterwards
were), Defoe's story falls to the ground.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity of adding, that, having been for many years a
collector of materials for a more methodical and accurate account of the
Hungerford family and their property, than has hitherto appeared, and
having completed the arrangement of what I have been able to collect, if
any of your readers or correspondents should have it in his power to
refer me to any sources of illustration, or to inform me of the
existence of anything that might throw light on the subject&mdash;such as old
deeds, seals, wills, entries in parish registers, family portraits, or
the like&mdash;they would be rendering a kind service.</p>

<span>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</span>
</h3>

<p>The <i>Salisbury Volume</i> of the Archæological Institute, which has just
been issued, contains some extremely interesting communications, among
which we must particularise for its agreeable character Mr. Hunter's
Reminiscences of the <i>Topographical Gatherings at Stourhead</i>,&mdash;for its
learning and originality, Mr. Guest's Memoir on the <i>Early English
Settlements in South Britain</i>.<a id="tain7"></a><a title="Go to footnote 7." href="#fn7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Mr. Smirke contributes a valuable
notice of the <i>Custumal of Bleadon</i>,&mdash;Mr. Newton, <i>Notes on the
Sculptures at Wilton</i>,&mdash;Mr. Hawkins on <i>The Mints of Wiltshire</i>; and not
the least interesting portion of the volume consists of notices
respecting <i>Silbury and Avebury</i>, by the late excellent and lamented
Dean of Hereford. The volume contains many other instructive memoirs,
and is well calculated to advance archæological knowledge.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn7"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#tain7" class="label">[7]</a> Mr.
 Guest's suggestion (p. 30.), that <i>Grimsditch</i> means a
boundary, deserves the attention of our correspondents.</p>

<p>The new volume of Bohn's <i>Standard Library</i> is the fourth of Mrs.
Foster's excellent translations of <i>Vasari's Lives of the most Eminent
Painters, Sculptors, and Architects</i>. It contains no fewer than nineteen
lives, including, among many whose names are less familiar to English
amateurs, those of Sebastian del Piombo, and that admirable scholar of
Raphael, whom Shakespeare has helped to immortalise by designating him
that "rare Italian master Giulio Romano." All lovers of art are under
great obligations to the publisher for placing this translation within
their reach.&mdash;Mr. Cyrus Redding's <i>History and Description of Modern
Wines</i> is the new volume of Bohn's <i>Illustrated Library</i>; and, as the
author describes "the art of taking wine" as "the science of exciting
agreeable conversation and eliciting brilliant thoughts," and discourses
learnedly upon the subject, his book may well find friends.&mdash;<i>Lucretius
on the Nature of Things, literally translated into English Prose</i>, by
the Rev. J. S. Watson, M.A., <i>to which is added the Poetical Version</i>,
by J. M. Good, is another volume of Bohn's <i>Classical Library</i>; and the
scholarship of Mr. Watson affords a sufficient justification for his
prefatory remark, "that he who wishes to know what is in Lucretius
without perusing the original, will learn it from this volume with
greater certainty<a id="Page_396"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[396]</span> than from any other previously offered to the
English reader." Every page bears evidence of the pains and ability
displayed by Mr. Watson in his endeavour to clothe Lucretius in an
English garb.</p>

<p>There is no Query so frequently put and so rarely answered to the
satisfaction of the Querist as <i>What is the fare?</i> Walker's <i>Cab Fare
and Guide Map of London</i>, in which all the leading streets and
thoroughfares are marked off in half-miles, being so small that it may
be carried in a pocket-book, yet so distinct as to admit of no doubt,
will however put an end to the very unpleasant state of uncertainty and
dispute in which all who ride in cabs are apt to find themselves
involved.</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
